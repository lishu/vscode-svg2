A scaled-baseline-table is a compound value with three components: a baseline-identifier for the dominant-baseline, a baseline-table and a baseline-table font-size. Some values of the property re-determine all three values; other only re-establish the baseline-table font-size. When the initial value, auto, would give an undesired result, this property can be used to explicitly set the desire scaled-baseline-table.\n\n🧧 *Provide by SVG extension.*\n\n[MDN References](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/dominant-baseline)",
